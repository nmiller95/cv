Astronomer with interests in observational stellar astrophysics and machine learning.
My research interests share a common theme of characterising the physical and atmospheric properties of solar to late-type stars in order to provide extremely precise constraints on the processes in stars as they evolve through the main sequence.
During my PhD, I developed a new method to measure fundamental effective temperatures for solar-type stars in detached eclipsing binaries, laying the foundations to build a homogeneous catalogue of benchmark stars with extremely precise model-independent masses, radii and temperatures.
